# üöÄ InstantMock

As GraphQL deployments scale, delays between front-end development, QA, and back-end API readiness can slow teams down. Adding the complexity of _distributed_ GraphQL ([Apollo Supergraphs](https://www.apollographql.com/federation), [Open Federation](https://open-federation.org/), [etc](https://grafbase.com/docs/federation)) can make this bottleneck even worse.

InstantMock allows you to mock GraphQL endpoints as quickly as it takes to write a query... aka... _instantly_!

## Key Features

- **Instant GraphQL Endpoint Creation**: Get a mock endpoint up and running in minutes.
- **Apollo Studio Schema Proposal Integration**: Create mocks directly for your schema proposals with full access to all schemas.
- **Realistic Mock Responses**: Tailor-made fake responses for accurate testing.
- **Advanced Data Seeding**: Populate your mocks with lifelike data for production-like testing scenarios.
- **Integration with Narrative Studio**: Fully integrated into Narrative Studio and supporting Narrative Driven Development (NDD)

Run InstantMock:

- Locally: Quick testing right on your machine.
- Using Docker: For containerized environments.
- Centrally Hosted: Share mocks with multiple teams using our AWS CDK templates (coming soon).
- With Corporate Proxies: Seamless integration in enterprise environments.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### üê≥ Docker (Recommended)

InstantMock runs by default on `localhost:3007`. If you want to run the app on another port, adjust the `PORT` and `REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL` variables in your `.env` file accordingly.

```Shell
mv .env.example .env
# Add your Apollo key to the .env file
docker compose up
```

### üì¶ Running locally with NodeJS

#### Node Version

This project uses `nvm` to manage node versions.

```Shell
brew install nvm
```

Once nvm is installed, navigate to project root and run `nvm use`

```Shell
nvm use

  Found '.nvmrc' with version <20.16.0>
  Now using node v20.16.0 (npm v10.8.1
```

#### Database

You will need a PostgreSQL database instance. You can either:

- Set one up locally,
- Use a remote instance,
- Or use the PostgreSQL instance that is started automatically with the above docker compose config.
  Make sure to adjust the database connection details in your .env file accordingly.

#### Server

The InstantMock server runs by default on port 3007. If you want to run the server on another port, adjust the `PORT` variable in your `.env` file. Also, remember to update the `REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL` in your `.env` file accordingly.

```Shell
cd backend
mv .env.example .env
# Add your Apollo key to the .env file
# Add your database connection details to the .env file
npm install
npm run dev
```

#### Client

The InstantMock client runs by default on port 3000. If you want to run it on another port, adjust the `PORT` variable in your `.env` file.

```Shell
cd frontend
mv .env.example .env
npm install
npm start
```
